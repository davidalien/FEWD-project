<p>Located in Lower Allston, Ettercap Audio serves recording artists in the Greater Boston Area by providing high quality recording services for little to no cost. We opereate out of a basement, but with our attention to detail and ability to workaround the less than ideal recording conditions, we are able to provide artists with good sonic results.</p>
